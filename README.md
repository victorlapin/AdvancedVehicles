# TonsOfEnemies

[Battletech Mod][ModTek] Introduces new vehicles, Mechs and turrets with some advanced weapons on board. NOT lore friendly!

## Details

This mod requires ModTek, Streak Missile Launchers and Haakon's Tons Of Guns.

**Why make this mod?**

Because although the Tons of Guns mod is great, and I really like additional flavor to the game, I would also like to encounter that stuff on the battlefield, and salvage it after the fight.

**What about the lore?**

Nothing. I'm not a die-hard lore nerd, so totally fine about RACs in 3025 environment. So I've tried to keep new vehicle variants close to existing ones, and I hope I didn't screw up too much.

## Thanks
* HBS (obviously)
* mad2342 (for streak missiles, also I'm using a whole bunch of your mods)
* HaakonTheViking (for tons of weapons)
* Axterix (for adding new tanks to the game, therefore providing me with the necessary examples)
