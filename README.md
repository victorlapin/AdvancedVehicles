# AdvancedVehicles

[Battletech Mod][ModTek] Introduces new vehicles and Mechs with some advanced weapons on board. NOT lore friendly!

## Details

This mod requires ModTek, Advanced Weapons and Streak Missile Launchers.

**Why make this mod?**

Because although the Advanced Weapons mod is great, and I really like additional flavor to the game, I would also like to encounter that stuff on the battlefield, and salvage it after the fight.

**Why tanks?**

They are easy to add, and I'm a novice modder.

**What about the lore?**

Nothing. I'm not a die-hard lore nerd, so totally fine about RACs in 3025 environment. So I've tried to keep new vehicle variants close to existing ones, and I hope I didn't screw up too much.

**What vehicles are there exactly?**
1. ATM Carrier. Similar to vanilla LRM Carrier, but loaded with iATM 12 + iATM6.
2. Inferno Carrier MkII. Similar to vanilla Inferno Carrier, but loaded with 3 Inferno ATM 3.
3. Scorpion MkIII. Vanilla Scorpion tank with HVAC/5.
4. Demolisher HVAC. Vanilla Demolisher tank with double HVAC/10.
5. Streak SRM Carrier. Similar to vanilla SRM Carrier, but loaded with 8 Streak SRMs instead of 10 regular SRMs.
6. Scorpion RAC. Vanilla Scorpion tank with RAC/2.

**Future plans?**

Not many right now. Maybe I'll try to add a "Thumpertank". Maybe I'll try to add more hardcore turrets.
